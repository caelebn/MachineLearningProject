# MachineLearningProject
Here, we have implemented a K-Nearest-Neighbor (KNN) classifier and a Naive Bayes classifier that predict the amount of review stars a given text review should be assigned. Review data is from Amazon. The code for KNN can be found within the Master Branch, whereas the code for Naive Bayes can be found under caelebn branch, as we did not have sufficient time to merge everything.

Uses lists assembled from Minqing Hu and Bing Liu. "Mining and Summarizing Customer Reviews." Proceedings of the ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD-2004), Aug 22-25, 2004, Seattle, Washington, USA. In order to count the net positivity of a given review.
