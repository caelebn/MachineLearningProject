# MachineLearningProject
The end goal of this project is to have a Machine Learning system in place that is trained off of user reviews from Amazon
to predict how many stars a user should give a product based off of their text review. To train the system and analyze an input,
we are using the KNN (K-Nearest-Neighbor) algorithm.
